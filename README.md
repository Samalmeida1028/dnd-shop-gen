# dnd-shop-gen

### Currently, this is a project to generate simple shops with an inventory saved to a JSON object file

Most of the functionality is in **main.py**

When running it, the user is presented with a simple terminal.
Type "help" to get a list of the currently supported commands

## Functions

The terminal right now allows users to create specific shops, generate random shops in a region, add new shop regions, add items
to shop regions, and enter shops and buy and sell specific items

**Because everything is saved in a JSON file, you can go into the text file and edit the parameters, and as long as the format
is maintained, it will change in the program when you restart it**

## TODO (in terminal app)

- Allow user to add new items to the item list
- Remove shops, remove items from shops, remove regions, and remove items from regions
- Rename Shops

## TODO (General)

- Add better comments
- Add more documentation :D
